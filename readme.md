# Corporate UI Development Repository

In this repository we're developing the next generation components for Corporate UI. We're improving a lot of our findings that we've done implementing the current production version of the library: https://github.com/scania/corporate-ui

## Quick start

Several options to add corporate-ui in the project: 

1. Add via CDN, link to the script by adding the following to the `<head></head>`.

```html
<script src="https://static.scania.com/build/global/4.x/corporate-ui.js"></script>
```
Replace the version number with the [available releases](https://github.com/scania/corporate-ui-dev/releases)

2. Install corporate-ui via NPM package by running the command below.

```
npm i corporate-ui-dev
```

Import component as a module with `defineCustomElements` function.

```js
import { defineCustomElements } from 'corporate-ui-dev/dist/define';

defineCustomElements(['c-theme','c-footer', 'c-content']);
// to import all components pass an 'all' value
// defineCustomElements('all');
```

See project examples for [Angular](https://github.com/scania/corporate-ui-angular) and [React](https://github.com/scania/corporate-ui-react).

## Setup local environment

- Clone the Corporate UI Dev repo: `git clone https://github.com/scania/corporate-ui-dev.git`
- Download and install node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/
- If you're behind a firewall, CONFIGURE THE PROXY
- From the corporate-ui-dev folder, run `npm i` to install package dependencies
- Start the local setup by running `npm start`
- Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:1337](http://localhost:1337)

## Requirements

**NodeJS: use 8.15 or newer stable version of node**

### Focus area

Focus is right now set on getting a solid architecture in place. Any of the basic components that you'll be able to view in this repository is not finalized when it comes to design and CSS values.

### Purpose

Corporate UI is a library for using and building web components as custom elements. Custom elements enables developers to in a really easy way apply branding guidelines and apply interaction patterns without having to build them all from scratch.

### Tech stack

Corporate UI outputs browser native code such as JavaScript, CSS and HTML. Although, behind the scenes a variety of tools are used. The technical infrastructure currently includes; Bootstrap, Sass, StencilJS, Redux, TSX, Travis, NPM, Gulp, esLint, Prettier, Jest, Puppeteer, Webpack and Storybook.

### Testing

Testing the components is done using the Stencil testing setup that includes unit test and End-to-End test. Both tests use Jest as the JavaScript testing solution. The browser environment for end-to-end testing is done using Puppeteer.

To test locally:

`npm test`
