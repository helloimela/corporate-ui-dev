## Coding Standard

We're contributing, and are following, the coding standards available at https://github.com/scania/coding-conventions.

## Opening a pull request

1. [Fork the repository](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) and clone it locally
   
   ```
   # Clone your fork of the repo 
   git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/corporate-ui-dev.git
   ```
   
2. Sync your local to the original “upstream” repository by adding it as a remote. Pull in changes from “upstream” often so that you stay up to date so that when you submit your pull request, merge conflicts will be less likely. Read more [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/syncing-a-fork). 

   ```
   # Navigate to the newly cloned repo
   cd corporate-ui-dev
   
   # Connect to the original "upstream" repo
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/scania/corporate-ui-dev.git
   ```
   
3. Create a branch for your edit. To pass travis build process, only create a branch name under one of these labels:
   - `improvement/` for improvement changes
   - `feature/` for a feature solution
   - `bug/` for bug fixes
   
   For example, if you want to create a bug fix, the branch name will be `bug/fix_for_something`.
   
   To create a branch, run the following command:
   
   `git checkout -b <branch-name>`

4. Refers to [any relevant issues](https://github.com/scania/corporate-ui-dev/issues) in the pull request. For example, write `Fixes #xxx` in the commit message to refers to a specific issue.

5. Open a pull request and write clear title and description in the pull request interface. In the right side of the screen, assign yourself in the pull request and add the correct label. You can also add a reviewer from Corporate ui team.
